# Giphy-API

Superheroes are all the rage today and so why not be able to get some wonderful gifs of them. 
In this assignment, we used the GIPHY API to create a web page that generate superhero gifs.
The assignment required us to:
- Use Javascript and jQuery to populate the site with gifs 
- Call on the GIPHY API to retrieve gis.
